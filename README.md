# Insight2015C-project

This was the consulting project I did for an ad-tech startup in NYC as a part of my time in the Insight Data Science fellowship in Fall of 2015.
The goal was to predict how to optimize target advertisements based on text contents of websites. 

I built an end-to-end pipeline that extracted NLP based features from the text of websites and fed it into a number of different classifiers
to perform prediction. The target being the degree of user engagement with the target ad. 

As this was a real consulting project for a startup, I have removed all the private datasets I used to perform the analysis
but the full write up of the pipeline is here: http://kuhanw.zohosites.com/. The pipeline code shown here is what I shipped to the company 
to be used in production.
