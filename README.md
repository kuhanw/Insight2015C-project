# FeatureRank

This was the consulting project I did for an ad-tech startup in NYC as a part of my time in the Insight Data Science fellowship in Fall of 2015.
The goal was to predict how to optimally place advertisements on select websites based on their content. 

I built an end-to-end pipeline that extracted NLP based features from the text of websites and fed it into a number of different classifiers
to perform prediction. The target being the degree of user engagement with the target ad. 

As this was a real consulting project for a startup, I have removed all the private datasets I used to perform the analysis
but the full write up of the pipeline is here: http://kuhanw.zohosites.com/. The pipeline code shown here is what I shipped to the company 
to be used in production.
